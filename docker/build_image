# This script is only a convenience as the build environment is controlled in
# the Dockerfile. That said, it uses only basic shell commands to help it work
# on developer laptops as well as CI nodes. Mainly, this centralizes the base
# Java image mappings and ensures all metadata needed is taken from pom.xml.
